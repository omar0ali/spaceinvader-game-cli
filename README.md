# Space Invader Game

A terminal-based implementation of the classic space invaders game written in Go, using the [tcell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell) library for handling terminal graphics and input. A simple game where the player controls spaceship with a laser, and shoots and destroy descending waves of alien invaders before they reach the bottom of the screen.
